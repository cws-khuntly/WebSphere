#
# This is the main IBM HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/httpserv/manual24/> for detailed 
# information about the Apache directives.
#
# The instructions provided in this configuration file are only hints or
# reminders.  Consult the online docs for definitive information.
#
# You are strongly encourated to start with the default configuration 
# and append your changes to the problem wherever possible, rather than
# changeing it in-line.
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the web server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same web server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/usr1/IBM/HTTPServer" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/usr1/IBM/HTTPServer/logs/foo.log".
